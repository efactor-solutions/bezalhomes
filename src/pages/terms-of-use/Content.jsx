                Description of Goods and Services: The Website can be used for
                payment of service fees, utilities and any other charges payable
                by you for management of the community, compliance with
                community rules or required by applicable law and in compliance
                with the relevant Document(s).
                <br />
                <br />
                It is your responsibility to ensure that any required payment is
                correctly and timely received by Bezal Homes. Accordingly, we
                accept no liability whatsoever in this respect, and we are under
                no obligation whatsoever to notify you of any incorrect,
                rejected and / or declined payments. You shall also ensure that
                sufficient credit is available and in the event of a “declined”
                credit card payment, it is your responsibility to pay any
                additional fees and / or charges levied by either a nominated
                financial institution or Bezal homes and you shall remain
                responsible to pay any due amounts. Without prejudice to the
                foregoing, you shall notify us immediately in the event of any
                failed transaction or if you face or encounter any technical
                problems associated with the Website or its use.
                <br />
                <br />
                If any transaction is found to be incorrect, unauthorized or
                fraudulent, the payment (and any related payments) may be
                reversed and payments shall remain due. Payment transactions
                will be processed within a reasonable timeframe of the
                transaction being submitted for payment, unless the transaction
                is submitted on a weekend or non-working weekday where payment
                will be processed within a reasonable timeframe of next working
                weekday.
                <br />
                <br />
                Upon receiving the funds into our bank account, we shall
                accordingly endeavour to issue a proper receipt acknowledging
                the same. All transactions will be processed without delay,
                however Bezal Homes expressly disclaims any and all liability
                for processing delays, which may occur in any circumstance.
                Payment is not accepted (not deemed made) until the funds have
                been cleared and such clearance has been confirmed by Bezal
                Homes.
                <br />
                <br />
                Refunds of any payments (if any) made through the Website are
                subject to the terms and conditions of the Document. Any
                duplicate or excess payments received will be adjusted against
                future/subsequent invoices at Bezal Homes’ exclusive discretion.
                It is your responsibility to maintain document evidencing
                payment though the Website. Any service or maintenance requests
