Cities evolve in layers.

Some developments respond to immediate demand.
Others introduce structure; redefining how space is organised, experienced, and remembered.

Chisco Court belongs to the latter.

Positioned across approximately **12,100 square metres in Lekki,** this mixed-use development has been conceived as a disciplined architectural composition. It does not rely on spectacle or density for significance. Instead, it derives its presence from proportion, hierarchy, and a clear understanding of how modern urban life should function.

Its landmark identity is not an aspiration.
It is the result of deliberate planning.

<h1 style="font-size: 32px; font-weight: bold;">The Master Plan </h1>

The strength of any enduring development lies in its plan.

At Chisco Court, spatial organisation precedes aesthetic expression. Circulation patterns are structured to minimise conflict between movement and stillness. Residential and commercial domains are positioned in intentional relationship - distinct, yet interconnected.

Public, semi-private, and private layers are clearly articulated. Built mass is balanced with open breathing space. Vertical scale is grounded by horizontal coherence. This orchestration creates a sense of order that is immediately perceptible, even before entering a single residence.

The estate is designed to feel resolved not improvised.

And within that resolution, daily life unfolds with quiet predictability and ease.

<h1 style="font-size: 32px; font-weight: bold;">The Residential Estate </h1>

Chisco Court comprises **34 four-bedroom residences,** positioned within a unified yet differentiated estate framework.

The collection includes:
- 10 Detached Residences with Two-Room BQ
- 14 Semi-Detached Residences with One-Room BQ
- 10 Terrace Residences with One-Room BQ

Each residence is structured around spatial hierarchy. Public zones are expansive and visually connected, allowing for continuity between living, dining, and circulation areas. Transitional spaces provide measured movement, preventing abrupt shifts between activity and rest.

Private quarters are deliberately set apart, creating a psychological retreat from the rhythm of the day.

Balconies, terraces, and rooftop environments extend the architectural envelope vertically. These elevated spaces introduce light, ventilation, and openness, not as ornament, but as functional extensions of living.

Material selection reflects durability and refinement. Surfaces are chosen to age gracefully. Details are restrained, allowing alignment, proportion, and geometry to define the visual language rather than embellishment.

The result is architecture that supports life without demanding attention from it.

<h1 style="font-size: 32px; font-weight: bold;">Chisco Mall<h1>

**Dual Six-Floor Commercial Blocks**
Anchoring the development are two six-floor commercial blocks, each crowned with accessible rooftop spaces.

Together, they establish the vertical identity of Chisco Court within Lekki’s evolving skyline. Their dual configuration introduces symmetry and rhythm, reinforcing the development’s landmark presence.

Internally, the mall structures accommodate layered retail, service, and leisure functions. Vertical stacking allows efficient land use while preserving horizontal coherence across the estate.

The relationship between commercial and residential zones has been carefully calibrated. Entry points, vehicular movement, pedestrian circulation, and visual corridors are structured to preserve residential privacy. Public vitality is contained within defined boundaries.

This is mixed-use planning shaped by discipline, ensuring convenience enhances the environment without disrupting its calm.

<h1 style="font-size: 32px; font-weight: bold;">Amenities & Infrastructure </h1>
Architecture is incomplete without reliable systems.

Chisco Court integrates infrastructure designed to sustain uninterrupted modern living:

- 24/7 power supply
- Advanced security architecture
- Integrated home automation
- Dedicated concierge services
- Swimming pool and fitness facilities
- Private pools in select residences
- EV charging infrastructure
- Rooftop terraces
- Clubhouse and communal spaces
- IMAX cinema

These components function as structural support rather than spectacle. They are embedded within the development’s framework, ensuring continuity, safety, and comfort.

When infrastructure operates seamlessly, life feels lighter. That is its purpose.

<h1 style="font-size: 32px; font-weight: bold;">Urban Context</h1>

Lekki continues to mature as a commercial and residential corridor, strengthened by expanding infrastructure and economic growth.

Within this dynamic environment, Chisco Court asserts a composed architectural presence. Its scale and integration contribute to the district’s urban evolution rather than reacting to it.

Where rapid construction can often feel transient, this development introduces a sense of permanence; an address designed to remain relevant across cycles of change.
It is structured for longevity.



<h1 style="font-size: 32px; font-weight: bold;">A Landmark by Design</h1>
Chisco Court reflects Bezal Homes’ commitment to disciplined development; a belief that architecture should be shaped by clarity, proportion, and long-term thinking.

It is defined by hierarchy rather than clutter.
By structure rather than excess.
By intention rather than impulse.

And beyond its formal composition, it offers something quieter: an environment where daily routines feel supported, where movement feels intuitive, and where space allows for both productivity and pause.

In a city that rarely slows down, that balance is rare.

A new landmark emerges.

Not through declaration,
but through design -
and through the lives it will quietly hold over time.
